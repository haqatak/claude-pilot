    question: "What is Claude CodePro?",
    answer: "Claude CodePro is a professional development environment for Claude Code. It provides a structured workflow with spec-driven development, TDD enforcement, persistent memory, semantic search, and a modular rules system - all running inside a Dev Container.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is Claude CodePro free?",
    answer: "Yes! Claude CodePro is completely free and open source under the AGPL-3.0 license. You can install it into any project and use all features without any cost.",
  },
  {
    question: "What IDEs are supported?",
    answer: "Claude CodePro works with VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf, and Antigravity. Any IDE with Dev Containers extension support should work. The experience is consistent across all supported IDEs.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need Docker?",
    answer: "Yes, you need a container runtime like Docker Desktop or OrbStack (macOS). Claude CodePro runs inside a Dev Container to provide complete isolation, consistent tooling, and cross-platform compatibility.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I customize the rules?",
    answer: "Add custom rules by creating .md files in .claude/rules/custom/. Standard rules in .claude/rules/standard/ are updated with each install. You can also use path-specific rules with YAML frontmatter to scope rules to specific files.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why shouldn't I use manual or auto compaction?",
    answer: "Claude CodePro is designed to use the full 200k context window. When context fills up, use /clear instead of /compact. Claude Mem automatically injects relevant context from your previous session when you continue with /implement. This ensures maximum context utilization with seamless session continuity.",
